D-FINE-seg is a framework for real-time **object detection**, **instance segmentation**, and **semantic segmentation** - one codebase, one config flag (`task: detect | segment | sem_seg`), five model sizes (N -> X).

- End-to-end workflow - dataset prep -> training (DDP, EMA, AMP, mosaic) -> export (ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO, CoreML, LiteRT) -> benchmarked multi-backend inference
- Accuracy - on Cityscapes, beats YOLO26 and RF-DETR on detection & instance-seg F1 and leads mIoU on semantic segmentation, at real-time latency with 2-3x fewer params; also higher F1 than YOLO26 on TACO and VisDrone (TensorRT FP16, end-to-end protocol)
- Paper - [D-FINE-seg: Object Detection and Instance Segmentation Framework with Multi-Backend Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23043)
- Not a fork: the detection core follows the [D-FINE paper](https://github.com/Peterande/D-FINE); segmentation heads, training, export and inference are implemented from scratch.

One frame, three tasks, one config flag:

## Highlights

- **Instance segmentation head** (`task: segment`) - lightweight mask head on top of D-FINE's HybridEncoder PAN outputs: stride 8/16/32 features fused to 1/4 resolution, then a dot-product between per-query mask embeddings (3-layer MLP) and the shared mask features yields per-instance masks
- **Semantic segmentation head** (`task: sem_seg`) - reuses the pretrained instance-seg mask fuser on full-frame features, followed by a small conv neck and 1x1 classifier: no queries, no NMS
- **Mask-aware training** - box-cropped BCE + Dice mask losses (instance seg) and CE + multi-class soft Dice with `ignore_index` (semantic seg), mask supervision inside contrastive denoising, and Dice + sigmoid-focal mask costs in the Hungarian matcher - all train-time only, zero inference cost
- **COCO-pretrained weights for detection *and* instance segmentation**, auto-downloaded on first use - fine-tuning starts from a trained mask decoder, not from scratch
- **Multi-channel inputs** - train on RGB + thermal / depth / NIR stacks (4-channel `.npy`), not just RGB
- **Modern training stack** - Muon optimizer, DDP, EMA, mosaic + affine augs, OneCycle, early stopping, WandB
- **Beyond the model** - ByteTrack tracking, SAM3 auto-labeling, Gradio demo, INT8 quantization (OpenVINO / CoreML / LiteRT)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install dfine-seg           # inference + training
pip install 'dfine-seg[all]'    # + every export backend, SAM3, Gradio demo
```

COCO-pretrained weights (detection **and** instance segmentation) auto-download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ArgoSA/D-FINE-seg) on first use - no manual download needed.

<details>
<summary>Extras, if you need them (backends are large and platform-specific)</summary>

| Install | Adds | For |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `pip install dfine-seg` | torch, torchvision, opencv, hydra, wandb, albumentations, … | inference + training |
| `pip install 'dfine-seg[export]'` | onnx, onnxruntime, openvino, nncf, coremltools | `dfine export` |
| `pip install 'dfine-seg[trt]'` | tensorrt *(Linux)* | TensorRT engines - build on the target GPU |
| `pip install 'dfine-seg[label]'` | transformers | SAM3 auto-labeling |
| `pip install 'dfine-seg[demo]'` | gradio | the Gradio UI |
| `pip install 'dfine-seg[all]'` | everything above | full setup |

</details>

Two-line predict:

```python
from dfine_seg import load_model, read_image

model = load_model("s")                              # COCO detection, weights auto-downloaded
model = load_model("s", task="segment")              # COCO instance segmentation
model = load_model("output/models/exp/model.pt")     # your checkpoint - size/task/classes/input size auto-detected
model = load_model("output/models/exp/model.engine") # any exported artifact, picked by extension

out = model(read_image("path/to/image.jpg"))[0]
print(out["boxes"], out["scores"], [model.names[int(i)] for i in out["labels"]])
```

`load_model` returns the very same wrapper you would construct by hand ([dfine_seg/infer/](https://github.com/ArgoHA/D-FINE-seg/blob/main/dfine_seg/infer/)) - it resolves the weights and picks the backend, then gets out of the way. Extra keyword arguments pass straight through (`load_model("s", conf_thresh=0.3)`), output tensors stay on the device the model ran on, and those wrapper files remain self-contained enough to copy into your own app.

To train from a pip install, materialize a config and go:

```bash
dfine init          # writes ./config.yaml - edit train.root and train.label_to_name
dfine split
dfine train         # Hydra overrides work: dfine train model_name=m train.epochs=100
```

#### From source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArgoHA/D-FINE-seg.git
cd D-FINE-seg
uv sync
```

This creates a `.venv/` with the package installed editable and every extra present, pinned by `uv.lock`. Activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`, or run anything via `uv run ...` (the Makefile already does this).

Pretrained weights are auto-downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ArgoSA/D-FINE-seg) on first use, so no manual setup is needed - into `pretrained/` for the config-driven commands, and into the shared Hugging Face cache for `load_model("s")` when there is no `pretrained/` copy to reuse. To download manually instead, grab `dfine_<size>_<dataset>.pt` (size ∈ {n, s, m, l, x}, dataset ∈ {coco, obj2coco}) and place it in `pretrained/`. Segmentation weights are also available in the Hugging Face model card.

### Prepare Your Data

Two annotation formats are supported: **YOLO** (default) and **COCO JSON**. Semantic segmentation uses **PNG masks** instead (see below).

#### YOLO format (default)

``` bash
data/dataset/
├── images/    # all images: .jpg, .png, etc. (.npy for multi-channel - see below)
└── labels/    # all labels: one .txt per image (same filename stem)
```

**Detection labels**: `class_id xc yc w h` (normalized)

**Segmentation labels**: `class_id x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xN yN` (normalized polygon coordinates)

**Input types & channel order**: 3-channel `.jpg`/`.png` (BGR, read via `cv2.imread`), 3-channel `.npy` (RGB, read via `np.load`), or 4-channel `.npy` (RGB+extras, e.g. RGB+thermal).

#### Semantic segmentation masks (`task: sem_seg`)

``` bash
data/dataset/
├── images/    # same as YOLO layout
└── labels/    # one single-channel uint8 .png per image (same stem), pixel value = class id
```

Every pixel gets a class from `label_to_name` (background included). Pixels with value `train.sem_seg.ignore_index` (default 255) are excluded from loss and metrics and during inference 255 is the "background" or "ignored" class. `dfine split` works unchanged; `keep_ratio: True` is supported (letterbox pad is filled with `ignore_index`, so pad pixels don't supervise); `coco_dataset: True` is not supported for this task.

#### Multi-channel inputs (RGB + thermal / depth / NIR / …)

Set `train.in_channels: 4` (3 or 4 supported) to train on RGB + one extra modality
(thermal / depth / NIR). Stacks are `.npy` uint8 HWC arrays in `images/` (RGB in planes
0-2, extras after) with YOLO labels as usual; a mismatched channel count is skipped with
a warning. See [dfine_seg/etl/m3fd_to_yolo.py](https://github.com/ArgoHA/D-FINE-seg/blob/main/dfine_seg/etl/m3fd_to_yolo.py) for a ready-made RGB+thermal converter.

#### COCO JSON format

Place standard COCO JSON annotation files alongside your images folder. Splits are detected automatically by filename:

``` bash
data/dataset/
├── images/       # all images
├── train.json    # COCO-format annotations for train split
├── val.json      # COCO-format annotations for val split
└── test.json     # (optional) COCO-format annotations for test split
```

Enable COCO mode by setting `coco_dataset: True` in your config (see below). No CSV split generation step is needed - the splits are read directly from the JSON files.

If you only have a single `coco.json`, run `dfine split` to produce `train.json` / `val.json` (and `test.json` when the ratios leave room) from it. It splits by image using the same `split:` ratios, seed and `ignore_negatives` as the YOLO path, keeps each image's annotations with it, and copies `categories` / `info` / `licenses` into every output.

### Configure

Edit `config.yaml` - key settings:

```yaml
task: detect  # detect | segment | sem_seg
exp_name: my_exp  # experiment name (used in output paths)
model_name: s  # n / s / m / l / x

train:
  root: /path/to/project  # project root, will be used for outputs
  data_path: /path/to/dataset  # folder with images/ and labels/ (YOLO) or *.json files (COCO)
  coco_dataset: False  # set True to use COCO JSON annotations (train.json / val.json / test.json)
  label_to_name:
    0: class_a
    1: class_b
  epochs: 75
  batch_size: 8
  img_size: [640, 640]  # (h, w)
```

### Usage

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `dfine init` | write `config.yaml` from the packaged template (`--task`, `--model`, `-d`, `--force`) |
| `dfine split` | create train/val CSV splits (test split if configured) |
| `dfine train` | train the model |
| `dfine export` | export to ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO, CoreML (+ LiteRT when named) |
| `dfine bench` | benchmark all exported models on the val set |
| `dfine infer` | run on test folder, save visualizations + YOLO txt predictions |
| `dfine check-errors` | compare predictions against GT, save only mismatches (FP/FN) |
| `dfine test-batching` | find optimal batch size for your GPU |
| `dfine ov-int8` | INT8 accuracy-aware quantization for OpenVINO (can take hours) |
| `dfine trt-int8` | TensorRT INT8 calibration |
| `dfine main` | train -> export -> bench in sequence (same as the bare `make` target) |
| `dfine demo` | launch the Gradio UI (needs `pip install 'dfine-seg[demo]'`) |
| `dfine predict` | run a model on an image or folder, no config needed |
| `dfine version` | print the installed version |

Notes:

- Most commands read `config.yaml` and work off your trained run; exceptions — `init` (writes the config), `predict`, `demo`, `version` (no config needed). Every command's flags, defaults and examples: `dfine <command> -h`.
- **YOLO format**: `dfine train` requires `train.csv` and `val.csv` in `train.data_path` (generated by `dfine split`).
- **COCO format**: set `coco_dataset: True` - `train.json` and `val.json` are loaded directly; `dfine split` is only needed if you have a single `coco.json` to split.
- `dfine infer` runs Torch inference on `train.path_to_test_data` and writes to `train.infer_path`. `infer` / `export` / `bench` auto-pick the latest `<exp_name>_<date>` run under `train.path_to_save`.

Every `dfine` command also has a `make` alias (`make train` == `dfine train`), and any config key can be overridden inline:

```bash
dfine train exp_name=my_exp model_name=m train.epochs=100
```

Enable **DDP** (multi-GPU) by setting `train.ddp.enabled: True` and `train.ddp.n_gpus: N` in config. Then just run `dfine train` - it auto-launches with `torchrun`.

### Training Features

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Muon optimizer** | Optional Newton–Schulz optimizer for encoder/decoder attention+MLP matrices |
| **DDP** | Multi-GPU distributed training with SyncBatchNorm |
| **AMP** | Automatic mixed precision (~40% less VRAM, ~15% faster) |
| **EMA** | Exponential moving average of weights |
| **Gradient accumulation** | Effective batch size = `batch_size x b_accum_steps` |
| **Gradient clipping** | Configurable max norm |
| **Mosaic augmentation** | 4-image mosaic with affine transforms (recommended for detection) |

| **Autoresearch harness** | Tooling to run agent in autoresearch format,  leaves under `experiments/`

## Export

| Format | Half Precision | Notes |
|:-------|:--------------:|:------|
| **ONNX** | - | With optional fused postprocessor |
| **TensorRT** | FP16 | Must be exported on the target GPU. **Static input shape only** |
| **OpenVINO** | FP16, INT8 | Single export for FP32 or FP16 (pick during inference) and separate INT8 quantization script |
| **CoreML** | FP16, INT8 | Cross-platform export, inference on macOS / iOS. FP32 and INT8 exported by default  |
| **LiteRT** | INT8 | On-device TFLite (mobile / edge). FP32 and INT8 exported by default |

> **Tip**: FP16 is the best latency/accuracy trade-off for GPU (TensorRT) and CPU (OpenVINO). For Apple Silicon (CoreML), FP32 is faster.

> **Warning**: run TensorRT engines at **batch 1**. On TRT 10.13.3.9 a batched engine does not compute batch elements independently - feeding four identical images through a single `execute_async_v3` call returns four different results (score spread up to 0.20, and different labels), so a detection's score depends on what it happened to be batched with. Batch 1 is exact, and reproduces in raw TensorRT for FP16 and FP32 and for every optimization-profile shape, while torch and ONNX Runtime stay identical across slots ([NVIDIA/TensorRT#4813](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/4813)).

After export, a parity self-check (`export.parity`, on by default) runs each backend on a shared input and writes one cosine per backend - over the sorted top-K detection scores vs torch - to `parity.csv` next to the weights.

For `task: sem_seg` every backend gets the same fused-argmax graph: a single int32 `sem_seg` output `[B, H, W]` (label map at input resolution, no detection postprocessor), and parity compares per-pixel argmax agreement instead of score cosine.

## Inference

### Backends

Six inference backends in `dfine_seg/infer/`:

| Backend | Format | Devices |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| **Torch** | `.pt` | CUDA, MPS, CPU |
| **TensorRT** | `.engine` | CUDA |
| **OpenVINO** | `.xml` | CPU, iGPU |
| **ONNX Runtime** | `.onnx` | CUDA, CPU |
| **CoreML** | `.mlpackage` | macOS (GPU), iOS |
| **LiteRT** | `.tflite` | CPU, mobile / edge (Android) |

Output contract: detection / instance segmentation wrappers return `labels`, `boxes`, `scores` (+ `masks` `[N, H, W]` for `segment`); sem_seg wrappers return a single `sem_seg` `[H, W]` label map at original image resolution. For sem_seg, `dfine infer` writes palette overlays + GT-style grayscale PNG label maps (crops and tracking are box-based and skipped).

Also provided:

- `Bytetrack` - simple implementation of object tracker
- `SAM3` - text-promptable zero-shot segmentation for auto-labeling (multi-class: repeat `--prompt` or pass `"car, person"`)

### Multi-Object Tracking

A simplified ByteTrack ([Zhang et al., ECCV 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06864)) is included for persistent object tracking across video frames - uses constant-velocity motion prediction with EMA-smoothed velocity instead of a Kalman filter, blends IoU with centroid distance in the match cost, and does per-class matching by default.

### Gradio Demo

```bash
dfine demo         # == make demo   (pip: pip install 'dfine-seg[demo]')
```

A web UI for running inference on uploaded images and videos (or a webcam snapshot). It starts on COCO detection `s` - no configuration, weights download on first use. The **Model** panel then swaps in any other model at runtime: a size preset, or a path/upload of your own `.pt` / `.onnx` / `.engine` / `.xml`, with a box for the class names. `detect`, `segment` and `sem_seg` checkpoints all render, and SAM3 is selectable as a second backend for text-promptable segmentation (prompts are comma- or newline-separated - each one becomes a class).

It serves on `0.0.0.0:7860` (LAN-reachable) and prints a warning on startup: the Model panel loads any path the browser sends, so anyone who can reach the port can load files off this machine. `dfine demo --host 127.0.0.1` restores local-only.

## Benchmarks

### Metrics

**Detection / instance segmentation** - GT objects and predictions are matched one-to-one: a prediction is a TP if IoU > 0.5 (box for `detect`, mask for `segment`) and the class matches; only the highest-IoU prediction per GT counts, extra overlapping ones are FPs; a class mismatch is one FP + one FN.

- **F1 / Precision / Recall** - computed from those TP/FP/FN counts at `train.conf_thresh`.
- **IoU** (penalized) - mean IoU over all outcomes: TPs contribute their IoU, FPs and FNs contribute 0 (= sum of TP IoUs / (TPs + FPs + FNs)).
- **mAP_50 / mAP_50_95** - COCO-style average precision (mask versions for `segment`).

**Semantic segmentation** - all metrics come from one pixel confusion matrix accumulated over the whole eval set at original image resolution (`ignore_index` pixels excluded). A pixel of class *i* predicted as *j* counts as an FN for *i* and an FP for *j* - each confused pixel penalizes both classes.

- **mIoU** (decision metric) - macro-averaged: per-class pixel IoU = TP / (TP + FP + FN), averaged over classes present in GT, so every class has equal weight regardless of pixel count.
- **pixel_acc** - micro: fraction of all valid pixels classified correctly, so it is dominated by large classes.

### Cityscapes - vs YOLO26 and RF-DETR (fine-tuning)

This is the main dataset where numbers are being updated. Other benchmarks are older and are not updated with every latency/accuracy improvement in this repo.
500 Cityscapes val images at original 2048x1024, TensorRT 10.13 FP16, batch 1, RTX 5070 Ti. Every framework runs its **own shipped inference code**, scored by one validator against the same GT. Confidence thresholds were calculated for each framework separately to maximixe the F1. Two latency columns - **e2e** (end-to-end, including each framework's CPU preprocessing) and **engine** (pure TensorRT execute) - because they can disagree. Full protocol and every known asymmetry: [cityscapes-benchmark](https://github.com/ArgoHA/cityscapes-benchmark).

> D-FINE-seg outperforms YOLO26 in fine-tuning setting on TACO dataset in F1-score across every model size (N/S/M/L/X). In segmentation task - ~75% higher mean relative F1-score and ~16% latency reduction. In detection task - ~80% higher F1-score and ~28% latency reduction.

Note: although D-FINE does not require NMS, it still provides a small accuracy boost, so NMS is enabled by default in the current version. This is included in the reported latency.
