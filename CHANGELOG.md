# Changelog

All notable changes to D-FINE-seg since the paper release will be documented in this file.

## 2026-02-28 - Improve Nano segmentation quality

- **Nano mask output resolution: 1/8 -> 1/4.** The backbone's 1/8 feature (HGNetV2 stage 2) is now passed directly to MaskDecoder, bypassing HybridEncoder. Previously, Nano only used 2 PAN scales (1/16, 1/32), producing 1/8 mask output — coarser than the 1/4 output of S/M/L/X models which use 3 scales (1/8, 1/16, 1/32). The low-level feature is extracted before the encoder and routed straight to MaskDecoder, keeping encoder computation unchanged.
- **Nano `mask_dim` reduced from 256 to 128**, matching the encoder hidden dimension for better efficiency.

#### Results (TACO dataset)

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| mIoU   | 0.096  | 0.107 (+11% relative) |
| Latency | 4.0 ms | 4.1 ms (+2%) |

## 2026-03-05 - Implement CoreML export and inference

- Export now also supports CoreML in fp32 and fp16.
- New inference module for CoreML. On m1pro fp32 was faster, so it is used by default
- Readme updated with benchmarks (TACO detectoin and segmentation, S model, m1 pro model)

## 2026-03-11 - CoreML int8

- Add int8 quantzation for CoreML, ruexported by default alongside with fp32 versionduring `make export`
- Adepted `make bench` to supprot macos and linux platforms automatically. Torch, OpenVINO, ONNX run for both. TensorRT - linux, CoreML - macos.

## 2026-04-05 - LiteRT export and COCO segmentation pretrained weights

- Add LiteRT export, inference class and update bench.py to include LiteRT
- Add support to coco dataset formats
- Add pretrained weights on COCO dataset for segmentation models (n, s, m, l, x)
- Convert all pretrained models to this repo format and pth -> pt

## 2026-04-14 - Run NMS in inference classes by default

Although D-FINE doesn't require a NMS, it still helps to boost the accuracy with a tiny latency increase. TensorRT FP16, 5070ti, model D-FINEm, VisDrone dataset:

| Metric | F1-score | Latency |
|--------|--------|-------|
| No NMS | 0.587 | 3.6 ms |
| With NMS | 0.605 | 3.8 ms |

Same behaviour on TACO dataset for both detectin and segmentation models.

## 2026-05-01 - Optimize TensorRT inference class

Several improvements in the TensorRT inference class. Although it doesn't support dynamic input size, it is very well optimized for the static input. With S size model latency went from 3.1ms to 2.1ms without changes in the accuracy.

Minor improvement - now pretrained weigts automatically download from HuggingFace

## 2026-05-24 - Multi-channel input support (RGB + thermal / depth / NIR / ...)

- New `train.in_channels` config (default 3). Set to `4` to train on RGB + one extra modality (thermal / depth / NIR). Supported range is 3 or 4 — higher counts hit cv2 Scalar / Albumentations limits and are rejected at config load.
- Multi-channel images are stored as `.npy` (HWC uint8) — byte-faithful via `np.load`, unlike multi-channel TIFF which `cv2.imread` silently mangles. Channel convention: RGB in planes 0..2, extras in 3..N-1.
- HGNetv2 stem conv is rewired for `in_channels=4`. Pretrained 3-channel weights are reused: stem is inflated to 4 channels by tiling the RGB filter mean, so COCO-pretrained fine-tuning still works out of the box.
- All inference backends (torch, onnx, openvino, tensorrt, coreml, litert) auto-detect channel count from the exported model and preprocess accordingly.
- `dfine_seg/etl/m3fd_to_yolo.py` converts the [M3FD](https://github.com/JinyuanLiu-CV/TarDAL) RGB+thermal benchmark (VOC XML + Vis/Ir PNGs) into the new layout as a reference example.

## 2026-06-21 - Muon + Adan optimizers

- New `dfine_seg/model/muon.py` (`MuonWithAuxAdam`): Muon (Jordan et al., 2024) routes the encoder/decoder attention/MLP weight matrices to Newton-Schulz-orthogonalized momentum, while backbone, norms, biases, embeddings, and det/mask heads stay on an AdamW aux path inside one optimizer. **On by default** (`train.use_muon: True`).
- Adan (Xie et al., arXiv:2208.06677) is selectable for the aux groups via `train.aux_optimizer: adamw|adan`, with `train.adan_lr_mult` and `train.adan_betas` knobs.
- Muon + Adan is the new best recipe on the VisDrone screen: +0.0078 mAP_50_95 over the AdamW-X reference, latency-neutral.

## 2026-07-11 - Semantic segmentation task

- New third task `task: sem_seg` — dense per-pixel classification, full pipeline (train / infer / export / bench).
- Head: `SemSegDecoder` reuses the pretrained `MaskDecoder` fuser from `dfine_seg_<size>_coco.pt` (backbone + encoder + fuser transfer; only the small neck/classifier train from scratch) + a train-only aux head for deep supervision. No queries, no NMS. Loss: CE + multi-class Dice + 0.4 aux-CE.
- Data: `labels/<stem>.png` (single-channel uint8, pixel value = class id); `train.sem_seg.ignore_index` (default 255) excluded from loss/metrics and used as mask fill for pad-introducing augs.
- Eval: decision metric mIoU from a pixel confusion matrix at original image resolution (same protocol in training eval and bench); new metrics — mIoU (macro) + pixel_acc (micro).
- Export: one fused-argmax graph for every backend — single int32 `sem_seg` `[B, H, W]` output; parity check compares per-pixel argmax agreement. Wrappers return `out["sem_seg"]` `[H, W]` label map at original resolution.

#### Results (Cityscapes Dataset, S @ 640, RTX 5070 Ti)

| Backend | mIoU | Latency |
|--------|------|---------|
| PyTorch fp32 | 0.728 | 9.8 ms |
| TensorRT fp16 | 0.728 | 2.0 ms |

## 2026-07-28 - Instance segmentation postprocessing speedup

E2E inference latency of instance segmentation model improved by 25% (4.1ms -> 3.09ms) for TensorRT. Minor speedups for other formats too.

## 2026-08-17 - Pypi

D-FINE-seg is now pip-installable, has a public Python API and CLI. Repo folders were renamed, inference class names were standardized (PEP8). Torch model now autodetects `model_name`, `task`, `num_classes` and `in_channels`. Demo is also updated, now has a dropdown menu with 10 pretrained weights and allows user to load his weights from the UI. Added meta data to the checkpoints, so pt weights contain training info like the model_name, task, num_classes, label_to_name...
