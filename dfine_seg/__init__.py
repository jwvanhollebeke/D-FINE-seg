"""D-FINE-seg: detection + instance segmentation + semantic segmentation.

```python
from dfine_seg import load_model, read_image

model = load_model("s")                       # COCO detection weights, auto-downloaded
out = model(read_image("path/to/image.jpg"))[0]
print(out["boxes"], out["scores"], [model.names[int(i)] for i in out["labels"]])
```

`load_model` returns the same inference wrapper you would build by hand
(`TorchModel`, `TRTModel`, …), so its output contract is the wrapper's own.
